# ROBOT SCHEDULER 

We have robots of different efficiencies performing a set number of tasks. 
Here I have used Genetical Algorithm to find the optimal solution. 

Variables: task_durations, task_priorities, robot_efficiencies are set at random You can go and change the generate_mock_data method for appropriate result.
